# What is JavaScript?
# -------------------
# JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side
# that allows you to make web pages interactive. Where HTML and CSS are languages that give
# structure and style to web pages, JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage a
# user. Common examples of JavaScript that you might use every day include the search box on Amazon,
# a news recap video embedded on The New York Times, or refreshing your Twitter feed.

# What is JavaScript used for?
# ----------------------------
# JavaScript is mainly used for web-based applications and web browsers. But JavaScript is also
# used beyond the Web in software, servers and embedded hardware controls. Here are some basic
# things JavaScript is used for:
        # Adding interactive behavior to web pages
        # Creating web and mobile apps
        # Building web servers and developing server applications
        # Game development

# inside an html doc you have to use <script></script>
# in html you should usually use hyphens (also in doc names) - spiritualize it
# use google chrome for testing (it's requirements are much more strict than in other browsers;
# means: if it doesn't work in chrome, you'll have to look closer)
# JS is case sensitive (lastName and lastname are two different variables!)
# 'var' is still a common way to create variables, but the modern way is 'let' (both are allowed ... yet)
# first character of a variable name must be a letter, underscore (_), or a dollar sign ($)
# Subsequent characters can be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs
# first character of a variable name can’t be a number.
# variable names can’t include a mathematical or logical operator in their name (for instance, 2*something or this+that)
# variable names can’t contain spaces
# you’re not allowed to use any special symbols, like my#num, num%, etc.
# JS is a hyphen free zone (they’re reserved for subtractions)

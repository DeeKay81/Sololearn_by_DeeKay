<h3>What is JavaScript?</h3>
JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side
that allows you to make web pages interactive. Where HTML and CSS are languages that give
structure and style to web pages, JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage a
user. Common examples of JavaScript that you might use every day include the search box on Amazon,
a news recap video embedded on The New York Times, or refreshing your Twitter feed.

<h3>What is JavaScript used for?</h3>
JavaScript is mainly used for web-based applications and web browsers. But JavaScript is also
used beyond the Web in software, servers and embedded hardware controls. Here are some basic
things JavaScript is used for:
<ul>
    <li>Adding interactive behavior to web pages</li>
    <li>Creating web and mobile apps</li>
    <li>Building web servers and developing server applications</li>
    <li>Game development</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Basics:</h3>
<ul>
<li>inside an html doc you have to use 'script' to write js</li>
<li>in html you should usually use hyphens (also in doc names) - spiritualize it use google chrome for testing (it's requirements are much more strict than in other browsers;</li>
<li>means: if it doesn't work in chrome, you'll have to look closer)</li>
<li>JS is case sensitive (lastName and lastname are two different variables!)</li>
<li>'var' is still a common way to create variables, but the modern way is 'let' (both are allowed ... yet)</li>
<li>first character of a variable name must be a letter, underscore (_), or a dollar sign ($)</li>
<li>Subsequent characters can be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs</li>
<li>first character of a variable name can’t be a number.</li>
<li>variable names can’t include a mathematical or logical operator in their name</li>
<li>(for instance, 2*something or this+that)</li>
<li>variable names can’t contain spaces</li>
<li>you’re not allowed to use any special symbols, like my#num, num%, etc.</li>
<li>JS is a hyphen free zone (they’re reserved for subtractions)</li>   
</ul>

<h5><u>Arithmetic Operators:</u></h5>

<br>
Ok, we all know the basics, but what does this 'increment' or 'decrement' do?<br>
<p>The increment operator increases the numeric value of its operand by 1. When placed before the operand, it’ll return the incremented value. When placed after it, it’ll return the original value and then increments the operand.</p>
<p>The decrement operator decreases the numeric value of its operand by 1. When placed before the operand, it’ll return the decremented value. When placed after the operand, it’ll return the original value and then decrements the operand.</p>
Let's say we have a variable x = 5 ...
<br>
Increment and Decrement see at this <a href="increment_decrement.html">increment_decrement.html</a> file. Run it in your chrome browser.
For an arithmetical example go to the <a href="practice.html"> practice.html</a> (task: office computers).
<h5><u>Assignment Operators:</u></h5>
Take a look at this picture over here: <a href="https://api.sololearn.com/DownloadFile?id=2747">get pic</a>.
They are used to assign values to variables.
<h5><u>Comparison Operators:</u></h5>
Take a look at this picture over there: <a href="https://api.sololearn.com/DownloadFile?id=2748"> get pic</a>.
We can use comparison operators in logical statements to find out if variables or values are different.
<br>
For a comparison example go to the <a href="practice.html"> practice.html</a> (task: find the adults).
<h5><u>Logical Operators:</u></h5>
Take a look at this picture over there: <a href="https://api.sololearn.com/DownloadFile?id=2749"> get pic</a>.
Logical Operators are also known as Boolean Operators, evaluate an expression and return true or false.
With logical operators you can connect as many expressions as you want or need to.
<br>
For a boolean example go to the <a href="practice.html"> practice.html</a> (task: noon or midnight).
